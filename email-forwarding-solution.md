# Email Forwarding Solution for DexiMind

## Current Issue
Formspree only sends emails to the configured owner email (`elkabiri.amine@gmail.com`), but users need to receive their login credentials directly.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Owner Notification with Action Required
The system now sends you an email with:
- User subscription details
- Generated login credentials
- Ready-to-send email template for the user
- Clear instructions to forward credentials

### 2. Immediate User Access
Users get:
- Temporary credentials shown on screen
- Immediate login capability
- Auto-filled login form

## How It Works Now

### When User Subscribes:
1. **System creates** temporary user account
2. **Sends email to owner** with credentials and email template
3. **Shows credentials** to user immediately
4. **User can login** right away

### Owner's Action Required:
1. **Check email** for subscription notification
2. **Copy the email template** provided
3. **Send to user** using the template
4. **User receives** official confirmation

## Email Template Provided

The system provides this ready-to-send template:

```
Subject: Welcome to DexiMind - Your Login Credentials

Dear [User Name],

Welcome to DexiMind! Your subscription has been successfully created.

Your Login Credentials:
Email: [user@email.com]
Password: [generated_password]

You can now:
1. Login to DexiMind using the credentials above
2. Start chatting with your AI agent
3. Explore automation capabilities

Please change your password after your first login for security.

If you have any questions, please contact support.

Best regards,
The DexiMind Team
