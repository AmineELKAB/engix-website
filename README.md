## Setup Instructions

### 1. Local Development
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
3. The website will work locally for testing

### 2. Image Setup
Place the following images in the `images/` directory:
- `contact-ai-modified.jpg` - Personal AI-modified picture for contact section
- `product-development.jpg` - Image representing product development services
- `technical-assistance.jpg` - Image representing technical assistance services

**Note**: If images are not available, the website will show broken image placeholders. Replace with actual images before deployment.
